Hello, I'm QIU Feng, a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong background in engineering and management science. I completed my Master's degree in Civil Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I focused on modern project management, intelligent construction, and sustainable development. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Management Science and Engineering from Huazhong Agricultural University.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply involved in research and practical projects, exploring topics such as smart construction, urban infrastructure development, and rural revitalization. My efforts have been recognized through several awards, including national scholarships and top prizes in academic competitions. I am also an active member of the Communist Party of China, committed to contributing to society through my work and research.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through internships at leading engineering firms, where I worked on major projects like ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and smart city initiatives. I am proficient in various software tools, including MATLAB, AutoCAD, and data analysis platforms, and I have a keen interest in emerging technologies like BIM and AI-driven construction.

Beyond the professional realm, I enjoy reading, writing, and exploring the world through photography and drone videography. I am also an avid sports enthusiast, passionate about basketball and badminton.

I am excited to share my journey and insights with you through this platform and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation and progress.
